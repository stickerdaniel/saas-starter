# ====================================
# Vercel Environment Variables
# ====================================
# Platform: Vercel (Project Settings → Environment Variables)
# Purpose: Automatic deployments (preview branches, PRs, and production)
# These variables are used by Vercel during build and at runtime

# Convex Deployment URL (REQUIRED - Runtime)
# Your production Convex deployment URL
# This is exposed to the client (PUBLIC_*)
# Get from: Convex Dashboard → Settings → Deployment URL
PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# Convex HTTP Actions URL (REQUIRED - Runtime)
# Required for Better Auth integration
# Same as PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL but with .convex.site instead of .convex.cloud
# Scopes: Production, Preview (use different values for each)
PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.site

# Convex Deploy Key (REQUIRED - Build-time)
# Automatically deploys your Convex functions during Vercel builds
# Format: prod:deployment-name|key
# Get from: Convex Dashboard → Settings → Deploy Keys → Generate Production Deploy Key
# Scopes: Production, Preview, Development (set for all)
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=prod:your-deployment|your-deploy-key

# Tolgee CLI Configuration (REQUIRED - Build-time only)
# Used during Vercel build to:
#   1. Tag all translation keys in code as "production" (lifecycle tracking)
#   2. Pull latest translations from Tolgee Cloud to src/i18n/
#   3. Bundle translations as staticData (no runtime API calls)
#
# Get your Project API Key from: https://app.tolgee.io → Project Settings → API keys
# Use a Project API Key (starts with tgpak_) - it includes the project ID automatically
# Scopes: Production, Preview, Development (set for all)
TOLGEE_API_KEY=tgpak_your_project_api_key_here

# PostHog Analytics (OPTIONAL - Runtime)
# Get from: https://posthog.com → Project Settings → Project API Key
# Note: PostHog API keys are safe to expose on the client (PUBLIC_*)
# Scopes: Production, Preview, Development (set for all)
PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY=phc_your_api_key_here
PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://eu.i.posthog.com # or https://us.i.posthog.com

# PostHog Cloudflare Proxy (OPTIONAL - Runtime, for ad blocker bypass)
# Set up a Cloudflare Worker to proxy PostHog requests when direct access is blocked
# See docs/posthog-proxy-setup.md for complete setup instructions
# Cost-optimization: Only used as fallback when direct PostHog access fails (~5-10% of users)
# Scopes: Production, Preview, Development (set for all)
# Example: https://metrics.yourdomain.com (use your custom Cloudflare Worker domain)
PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROXY_HOST=https://metrics.yourdomain.com

# SnapDOM CORS Proxy (OPTIONAL - Runtime, for screenshot capture with external images)
# Set up a Cloudflare Worker to proxy external image requests for screenshot capture
# See docs/screenshot-proxy-setup.md for complete setup instructions
# Only needed if screenshots include external images from domains without CORS headers
# Development uses public proxy automatically - this is only needed for Production/Preview
# Scopes: Production, Preview (optional - leave empty to disable proxy in prod)
# Example: https://img-proxy.yourdomain.com/?url= (use your custom Cloudflare Worker domain)
PUBLIC_SNAPDOM_PROXY_URL=https://img-proxy.yourdomain.com/?url=

# ====================================
# How to set these in Vercel:
# ====================================
# 1. Go to your project on Vercel Dashboard
# 2. Settings → Environment Variables
# 3. Add each variable above
# 4. Set scope for each:
#    - PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL: Production, Preview, Development
#    - CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY: Production, Preview, Development
#    - TOLGEE_API_KEY: Production, Preview, Development
