# Platform: Vercel (Project Settings → Environment Variables)
# Purpose: Automatic deployments (preview branches, PRs, and production)
# These variables are used by Vercel during build and at runtime

# Convex Deployment URL (REQUIRED - Runtime)

CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=prod:your-deployment|your-deploy-key

# Tolgee CLI Configuration (REQUIRED - Build-time only)
# Used during Vercel build to:
#   1. Tag all translation keys in code as "production" (lifecycle tracking)
#   2. Pull latest translations from Tolgee Cloud to src/i18n/
#   3. Bundle translations as staticData (no runtime API calls)
#
# Get your Project API Key from: https://app.tolgee.io → Project Settings → API keys
# Use a Project API Key (starts with tgpak_) - it includes the project ID automatically
# Scopes: Production, Preview, Development (set for all)
TOLGEE_API_KEY=tgpak_your_project_api_key_here
