# Tolgee Development Configuration (https://app.tolgee.io)
# Get your Project API Key from: Project Settings -> API keys -> Create API key
# Use a Project API Key (not Personal Access Token) - it includes the project ID automatically
#
# NOTE: In development, Tolgee uses staticData (bundled translations) + DevTools
# The API key is ONLY used by DevTools for in-context editing
# In production, DevTools is auto-removed and no API calls are made

# Tolgee CLI Configuration (for pulling translations and local CLI usage)
# Uses the same Project API Key as above, but CLI reads from TOLGEE_API_KEY
# Run `bunx tolgee pull` to download latest translations to src/i18n/
# No project ID needed - it's automatically inferred from the Project API Key

# PostHog Cloudflare Proxy (OPTIONAL - for ad blocker bypass)
# Set up a Cloudflare Worker to proxy PostHog requests when direct access is blocked
# See docs/posthog-proxy-setup.md for complete setup instructions
# Cost-optimization: Only used as fallback when direct PostHog access fails (~5-10% of users)
# Example: https://metrics.yourdomain.com (use your custom Cloudflare Worker domain)

# SnapDOM CORS Proxy (OPTIONAL - for screenshot capture with external images)
# Development: Automatically uses public proxy (corsproxy.io) - no setup needed
# Production: Set up your own Cloudflare Worker for better security/reliability
# See docs/screenshot-proxy-setup.md for Cloudflare Worker setup instructions
# Only needed if screenshots include external images from domains without CORS headers
# Example: https://img-proxy.yourdomain.com/?url= (use your custom Cloudflare Worker domain)
