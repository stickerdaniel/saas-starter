# ====================================
# GitHub Actions CI/CD Secrets
# ====================================
# Platform: GitHub Actions (Repository Settings → Secrets → Actions)
# Purpose: Continuous Integration - testing and quality checks
# These secrets are used during CI builds for testing (NOT for deployment)

# Convex Test Environment
# Use a separate test Convex deployment to keep production data clean
# Set this to your development/test Convex deployment URL
# IMPORTANT: The test deployment must have the required env vars set via CLI.
# See .env.convex.example for the full list of required backend env vars
TEST_CONVEX_URL=https://your-test-deployment.convex.cloud

# Convex Site URL (for Better Auth)
# Same as TEST_CONVEX_URL but with .convex.site instead of .convex.cloud
TEST_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://your-test-deployment.convex.site

# E2E Test Secret
# Test users are automatically created with unique emails each run
# and deleted after tests complete. Only this secret is needed.
# Must match value in Convex: bunx convex env set AUTH_E2E_TEST_SECRET <value>
AUTH_E2E_TEST_SECRET=your-secure-random-test-secret

# Tolgee CLI Configuration (for tagging production keys)
# For Tolgee Cloud (free tier  <500 keys): Get from https://app.tolgee.io -> Project Settings -> API keys
# For self-hosted (unlimited keys): Update .tolgeerc apiUrl to your instance
# Use a Project API Key (starts with tgpak_) - it includes the project ID automatically
# Used by CI to tag translation keys found in code as "production" (for lifecycle tracking)
TOLGEE_API_KEY=tgpak_your_project_api_key_here

# ====================================
# How to set these in GitHub:
# ====================================
# 1. Go to your repository on GitHub
# 2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# 3. Click "New repository secret"
# 4. Add each variable above as a separate secret
