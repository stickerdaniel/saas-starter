# ====================================
# GitHub Actions CI/CD Secrets
# ====================================
# Platform: GitHub Actions (Repository Settings → Secrets → Actions)
# Purpose: Continuous Integration - testing and quality checks
# These secrets are used during CI builds for testing (NOT for deployment)

# Convex Test Environment
# Use a separate test Convex deployment to keep production data clean
# Set this to your development/test Convex deployment URL
TEST_CONVEX_URL=https://your-test-deployment.convex.cloud

# Convex Site URL (for Better Auth)
# Same as TEST_CONVEX_URL but with .convex.site instead of .convex.cloud
TEST_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://your-test-deployment.convex.site

# E2E Test Authentication Secret
# Must match the value set in your Convex backend:
#   bunx convex env set AUTH_E2E_TEST_SECRET your-secret-here
# Used by Playwright E2E tests for authentication
AUTH_E2E_TEST_SECRET=your-test-secret-here

# Tolgee CLI Configuration (for tagging production keys)
# Get your Project API Key from: https://app.tolgee.io → Project Settings → API keys
# Use a Project API Key (starts with tgpak_) - it includes the project ID automatically
# Used by CI to tag translation keys found in code as "production" (for lifecycle tracking)
TOLGEE_API_KEY=tgpak_your_project_api_key_here

# ====================================
# How to set these in GitHub:
# ====================================
# 1. Go to your repository on GitHub
# 2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# 3. Click "New repository secret"
# 4. Add each variable above as a separate secret
